# CAP Platform Blueprints

![CAP Platform Blueprints](docs/images/home.png?raw=true "CAP Platform Blueprints")
CAPRI project brings Cognitive Solutions to every key manufacturing stage and addresses the Process Industry challenges in three complementary industrial use cases belonging to minerals, chemical and steel sectors.
In this repository are reported the three Blueprints coming from the Asphalt, Steel and Pharma domains where the CAP Platform is adopted.
Since the platform is totally customizable, each domain selected the components to satisfy its own needs. In the dedicated folders is described how to deploy the customized CAP can be used as a starting point for future developments.
The CAP platform is created and distributed using Docker, the result is a platform OS independent and runnable through the compose where all the platform’s services are configured.
